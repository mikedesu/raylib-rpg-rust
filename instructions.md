# instructions.md

this project is to begin as a basic rust program that uses raylib's bindings.

we will break this down into phases.

`checklist.md` contains the instructions for writing the main program, `main.rs`.

i know we need a `cargo` file for dependency management, and I'd like a `Makefile` for easier building and cleaning. 

only perform 1 task in `checklist.md` at a time. inform me of the changes made. update the file to mark the task as complete, then prompt me when you are ready to do the next task.
